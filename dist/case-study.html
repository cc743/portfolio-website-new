      <h1>Case Study for MyFlix Full-Stack Project</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="intro-content">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            myFlix is a web application for movies.  myFlix provides registered users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres.
            The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).  The server-side of the application, including the server, business logic,
            and business layer, was built first. The client side was built with React, and was built in the form of a single-page responsive application.  
          </p>
          
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of the project was to build a complete web application (client-side and server-side) in order to demonstrate mastery of full stack JavaScript development.
            This project was built for the CareerFoundry Full Stack Immersion course.  The intention of the project was to teach that both front-end and back-end are important skills
            to have as a JavaScript developer; developing a project using the MERN stack was the way to teach such a lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, a second client-side was built with Angular, as an introduction to the Angular framework.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            One objective of the myFlix project is to build a full web application, both the client-side and the server-side.  Another objective was to include a 
            comprehensive project for my portfolio website.

          <h3>Server-Side</h3>
          <p>
            I built the API using Node.js and Express.  I implemented REST architecture and defined HTTP endpoints for the API.  I used MongoDB in order to build the 
            non-relational database for all movie data.  Business logic was modeled using Mongoose, and authentication/authorization was implemented using basic HTTP 
            authentication and JWT authentication.  Data validation logic was incorporated into the API.   Finally, I hosted the project on the web with Heroku.

          <br>
          
          <p>
            As can be seen in the server-side screenshot, I used Postman to test the API; this includes all HTTP requests implemented in the API, 
            such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

          <h3>Client-Side</h3>
          <p>
            React was chosen as the library to best implement the client-side as a responsive, single-page application with a polished user experience.  The client-side 
            interface allows users to properly make requests to, and receive responses from, the server-side.  I implemented state-routing to navigate between all views and 
            share URLs.  The app’s features includes a main-view, a single movie view, a profile view, a filtering tool to filter movies by title, and the ability for the user 
            to add and remove films from the user’s list of favorite movies.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          On the server-side, the main problems I faced were with Mongo.  My first approach to setting up Mongo was to install MongoDB via Ubuntu.  This proved to be 
          troublesome; when consulting with my tutor and other students, many had trouble making Mongo work with Ubuntu on Windows.  Thus, I was forced to take a different 
          approach; setting up the database directly on MongoDB Atlas, an online service in which I can create, and host, databases. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On the client-side, I faced challenges more so on understanding and then implements React concepts, as I was learning React for the first time. I faced challenges with 
          app routing in React and in implementing Redux.  However, extensive help from my tutor and mentor helped me in overcoming challenges learning React.
        </p>

      <div class="duration">
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>
          Development of the server-side took approximately 3 weeks. Development was lengthened by trouble with setting up MongoDB; a different approach than originally expected 
          had to be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development of the client-side took approximately 3 weeks.  I faced challenges in learning and developing with React for the first time.  However, I received plenty of 
          support from my course mentor and tutor.  In particular, I want to credit my mentor for providing various pair-programming sessions during this period.  What resulted is a 
          fully developed client-side in quicker time than I expected.
